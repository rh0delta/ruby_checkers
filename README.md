# Ruby Checkers

This is my very own version of the all-time classic game Checkers. The difference between this version and the one your parents are accustomed to is that this all done through the command line. The rules are exactly the same as the board-game version, with a few extra 'tweaks'. With this command-line version there is an added feature where you can create dynamic gameboards.
